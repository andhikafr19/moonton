## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains over 2000 video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.

## Documentation, Installation, and Usage Instructions

See the [documentation](https://spatie.be/docs/laravel-permission/) for detailed installation and usage instructions.

## What It Does
This package allows you to manage user permissions and roles in a database.

Once installed you can do stuff like this:

```php
// Adding permissions to a user
$user->givePermissionTo('edit articles');

// Adding permissions via a role
$user->assignRole('writer');

$role->givePermissionTo('edit articles');
```

Because all permissions will be registered on [Laravel's gate](https://laravel.com/docs/authorization), you can check if a user has a permission with Laravel's default `can` function:

```php
$user->can('edit articles');
```

This package is heavily based on [Jeffrey Way](https://twitter.com/jeffrey_way)'s awesome [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) lessons
on [permissions and roles](https://laracasts.com/series/whats-new-in-laravel-5-1/episodes/16). His original code
can be found [in this repo on GitHub](https://github.com/laracasts/laravel-5-roles-and-permissions-demo).

Special thanks to [Alex Vanderbist](https://github.com/AlexVanderbist) who greatly helped with `v2`, and to [Chris Brown](https://github.com/drbyte) for his longtime support  helping us maintain the package.

## Alternatives

- [Povilas Korop](https://twitter.com/@povilaskorop) did an excellent job listing the alternatives [in an article on Laravel News](https://laravel-news.com/two-best-roles-permissions-packages). In that same article, he compares laravel-permission to [Joseph Silber](https://github.com/JosephSilber)'s [Bouncer]((https://github.com/JosephSilber/bouncer)), which in our book is also an excellent package.
- [ultraware/roles](https://github.com/ultraware/roles) takes a slightly different approach to its features.
- [santigarcor/laratrust](https://github.com/santigarcor/laratrust) implements team support
- [zizaco/entrust](https://github.com/zizaco/entrust) offers some wildcard pattern matching
